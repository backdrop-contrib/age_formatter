Age Formatter
======================

This module provides a field formatter for integer fields that computes current
age from year born.

Add an integer field to collect the year someone was born and use this formatter
to compute their approximate age. (Since we are not taking into account what month they were born and what month it is now, this value may be off by up to 1 year).
